## Obejective

1. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
2. The portraits weâ€™ve used in the design files are stock photos downloaded from pexels.com. If you donâ€™t have a picture of yourself handy, feel free to go grab a placeholder for now.
3. Select your fonts! 
4. In the design we have icon-links for GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter. Obviously feel free to add whatever links you want to your own site. 
5. You can organize your work on this project however you please. Weâ€™ve given you many tips over the past several lessons, and you are likely already comfortable starting from a blank page.
